# Simplify testing of REST APIs using PowerShell and AutoRest

Testing REST APIs can be a pain.
First you must construct you URI,
then you decide what headers you need,
maybe it needs a body…
Then you’ll throw it in tools like cURL or Postman and hope you’ve formatted it correctly.
What if it didn’t have to be that way?
What if you could interact with your REST API from the comfort of your terminal without having to build a single URL.

In this talk, we’ll take a look at a few awesome tools for testing REST APIs and how they come together:
- Swagger/OpenAPI – a way to specify exactly what your REST API does
- AutoRest – a tool that can autogenerate code that interacts with all the endpoints of your REST API
- PowerShell – a cross-platform shell and scripting language that’s great for automation
