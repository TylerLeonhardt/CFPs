# Auto generate code to interact with your REST API using AutoRest

Does your code depend on crafting HTTP requests to REST APIs?

Have you ever wished that you could interact with your REST API as if it were a module or package in the language of your choice?

If so,
this talk is for you.

The AutoRest tool generates client libraries for accessing RESTful web services.
It leverages a specification called OpenAPI
(formerly known as Swagger)
which allows you define your REST API endpoints in a declaritive way.

In this talk,
we’ll take a look at these awesome tools for interacting with REST APIs and how they come together.

We'll also be autogenerating PowerShell and TypeScript code and stress test AutoRest by supplying it OpenAPI specs that I found online.
