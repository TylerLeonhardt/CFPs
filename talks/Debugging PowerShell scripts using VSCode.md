# Visual Studio Code: deep dive into debugging your PowerShell scripts

Visual Studio Code
(or VSCode for short)
is a free,
light weight,
extensible,
text editor by Microsoft.
It’s also the official editor for PowerShell development – superseding the ISE.

In this talk,
I’ll show you how to get VSCode set up for use with PowerShell and then we’ll take a close look at the debugging experience in VSCode.
By the end of the talk,
you’ll walk away with the skills needed to debug your scripts and even the ability to customize the debugging experience for your use-cases.

If you are new to VSCode,
we recommend you watch the introductory video before joining this session: https://youtu.be/bGn45vIeAMM
