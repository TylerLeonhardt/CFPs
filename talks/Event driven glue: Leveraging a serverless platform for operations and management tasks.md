*The description will be seen by reviewers during the CFP process and may eventually be seen by the attendees of the event. You should make the description of your talk as compelling and exciting as possible. Remember, you're selling both the organizers of the events to select your talk, as well as trying to convince attendees your talk is the one they should see.*

You've got client facing serverless code everywhere... but all your operations tasks like managing databases, access control to production resources, etc. is all manually done. What if it didn't have to be like this? What if you could automate a lot of these management task while also using the same serverless stack for this as well?

In this talk we'll look at how to use the event-driven serverless paradigm for management and operations task. You'll leave with a foundational understanding of how to leverage these platforms for management and operations tasks and how to discover tasks that could be automated.

Possible demos could include:

* Cleaning up stale resources used for testing/R&D
* Giving a user permissions to some resource (subscription, key vault, etc)
* 

## Notes

*Notes will only be seen by reviewers during the CFP process. This is where you should explain things such as technical requirements, why you're the best person to speak on this subject, etc...*
