# Management & Operations in the Serverless space: A brief history

or

# Web Apps were not the first "Serverless": A brief history

## Elevator Pitch

*You have 300 characters to sell your talk. This is known as the "elevator pitch". Make it as exciting and enticing as possible.*

Long before the term "serverless" and modern Function-as-a-service offerings emerged, event-driven cloud compute was used all over the management and operations space. In this talk, we'll look at "serverless" before "serverless" and why you should consider this paradigm for non-client facing tasks.

## Description

*The description will be seen by reviewers during the CFP process and may eventually be seen by the attendees of the event. You should make the description of your talk as compelling and exciting as possible. Remember, you're selling both the organizers of the events to select your talk, as well as trying to convince attendees your talk is the one they should see.*

## Notes

*Notes will only be seen by reviewers during the CFP process. This is where you should explain things such as technical requirements, why you're the best person to speak on this subject, etc...*
